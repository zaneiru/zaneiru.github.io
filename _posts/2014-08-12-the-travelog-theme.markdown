Travelog is a theme for Jekyll that is both elegant and downright simple.

In addition to being devilishly handsome, it is responsive down to mobile and has a very light footprint. Travelog lends itself well to photography and travel journaling.

Like a backpack with too many straps, a blog can sometimes be frustrating when it has too many bells and whistles. It is with that philosophy that I have put together this theme so that you might drown in its whitespace.

<div class="post-image">
    <img src="http://placehold.it/885x500" />
    <p class="post-image-caption">Using a little bit of markup, you can add beautiful captions to your totally beautiful pictures. Amazing.</p>
</div>

<div class="post-image post-image--split">
    <a href="#">
        <img src="http://placehold.it/435x500" />
    </a>
    <a href="#">
        <img src="http://placehold.it/435x500" />
    </a>
    <p class="post-image-caption">
    	<span class="post-image-caption-left">
    		Expanding on this, you can show two images side-by-side
    	</span>
    	<span class="post-image-caption-right">
    		And even define separate captions for each.
    	</span>
    </p>
</div>
